# To-Do's

- [x] Implement onDragNode orientation fixing that keeps the normals of the node pointing away from the center of the sphere, just as the node is kept to the edge of the sphere

- [x] Implement camera/scene position, rotation, zoom display in the GUI

- [x] Fix bug where icons sometimes "blip" as the camera rotates around the scene

- [ ] Implement a way to add new nodes to the scene (add a button, or, double click on the sphere)

- [ ] Implement a way to remove nodes from the scene (select a node and hit the delete key)

- [ ] Make the canvas resize when the window dimensions change

- [ ] Fix orientation of node icons so the top and bottom of the icons are always aligned with sphere north and sphere south while still respecting the normal orientation of the node icon
